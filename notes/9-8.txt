Methods for solving recurrences, mothds for solving recursion running time

iteration method
substitution method
recursion tree method
master method(considered easiest, however caveated)

Unless explicitly asked, use whichever you prefer

T(n) = n + T(n-1)
  
Substitution method:
	1. guess a sol
		T(n)=O(g(n)) (upper bound)
		asymptotic notation 
	T(n) <= d g(n) for some d>0 and n >- n0
	induct hypothesis T(k) <= d g(k) for all k < n
	goal: find some values of the constants d and n0 for which the induction goal holds
	2. use induction to prove


complexity of recurrence too difficult to deduce,
you can bound it by guess and check



Recursion Tree
	gives estimate, can be used as a input to substitution
