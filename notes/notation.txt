O (==) -> to boolean
theta (>=) -> to boolean
omega (<=) -> to boolean


ungeneralized vs. generalized.
edge cases at boundary of input domain, and actual case

certain strategies are generalized best for certain problems, 
however boundary cases and actual cases may prove otherwise, i.e. need to test based on prediction and intuition

modifications of data representation/combination of strategy==utilizing space complexity for net benefit

asked for min/max -> optimization
